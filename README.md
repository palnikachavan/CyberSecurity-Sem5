This repository contains the implementation of several fundamental algorithms in cybersecurity, including 
Euclid's algorithm, 
Extended Euclid's algorithm, 
Simplified DES (SDES), 
RSA encryption, and 
the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. 

To run these implementations, you will need:
Python 3.x and Java depending on the implementation.
Basic understanding of cryptography.
For RSA Python's random module for generating keys and bit manipulations.
